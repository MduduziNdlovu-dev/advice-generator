## 🌍 Overview

### 💪 The Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it (which I already did), was to build an app that:

- Displays advice fetched from an API 📜
- Looks awesome on any device 📱💻🖥️
- Reacts to hover states like a cat to a laser pointer 🐈🔴
- Generates fresh wisdom when you click the dice icon 🎲

## 🔨 My Process

### 🏗️ Built With

- **HTML5** - Because we’re civilized.
- **CSS3** - Styled with custom properties and just enough Flexbox & Grid magic. ✨
- **React** - Because life is too short for vanilla JavaScript. ⚛️
- **Next.js** - Faster than my morning coffee. ☕⚡
- **Styled Components** - Because inline styles are a crime. 🚓

### 🧠 What I Learned

This project reminded me that:

- APIs can be both a blessing and a curse. One minute you’re getting golden nuggets of wisdom, the next you’re staring at a 404 error. 😅
- Styled Components are pretty neat, but CSS Grid still reigns supreme. 👑
- Always double-check your API response before trying to display it (otherwise, enjoy staring at `undefined` for hours). 🤦‍♂️

Here’s a cool snippet of my API-fetching magic:

```tsx
const fetchAdvice = async () => {
  try {
    const res = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
    const data = await res.json();
    setAdvice(data.slip.advice);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Oops, no wisdom today!", err);
  }
};
```

### 🚀 Continued Development

Going forward, I’d love to:

- Maybe even turn this into an *Advice-a-Day* widget for my future projects!
